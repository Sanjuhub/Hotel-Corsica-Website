            <p>Room was very neat and clean. Spacious enough for two people. The room service was very good. The location is easily accessible. Good parking space. The buffet breakfast was awesome. But otherwise the food pricing was little costly. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.</p>

              <p>I miss my stay at Hotel Corsica. The staff makes you feel at home. It is probably my best stay possible away from home. A big thanks to all.</p>
